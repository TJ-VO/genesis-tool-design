## Sample 1: Zero-Access Encryption Service

### Purpose

Implements user-specific encryption where only the user can decrypt their data. The architecture is designed to prevent server operator access to encrypted content.

### Key Features

- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** key derivation with 600,000 iterations ([OWASP 2023 recommendation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2))
- **Fernet** symmetric encryption (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256)
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: encryption keys derived from password, never stored persistently
- **Three initialization modes**: password+salt (login), base64 key from JWT (subsequent requests), or key reconstruction

### Code

```python
"""

### Design Decisions

**Why PBKDF2 over Argon2?**

Genesis-Tool uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 for key derivation. While Argon2 is considered the state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm (winner of the Password Hashing Competition 2015), PBKDF2 was chosen for the following reasons:

- **OWASP Compliance**: PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations meets [OWASP 2023 recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) for password-based key derivation
- **Broader Compatibility**: PBKDF2 is FIPS-approved (FIPS 140-2) and has native support in Python's standard cryptography library, ensuring wider deployment compatibility
- **Threat Model Alignment**: While Argon2 offers superior resistance to GPU/ASIC attacks through memory-hardness, PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations provides sufficient protection for the Genesis-Tool threat model (individual user data with user-controlled passwords, not high-value centralized targets)
- **Implementation Simplicity**: No additional C library dependencies required, reducing attack surface and deployment complexity
- **Future Migration Path**: Database schema and architecture support algorithm upgrades if threat landscape evolves

**Important Note:** For high-security deployments or enterprise use cases, Argon2 integration is planned as an optional upgrade path. The modular design allows algorithm swapping without breaking existing encrypted data.

**Why 600,000 iterations?**
- [OWASP 2023 recommendation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2) for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- Balances security (brute-force resistance) and performance (acceptable on modern hardware: ~100-200ms on typical systems)
- Future-proof against increasing computational power (OWASP updates recommendations as hardware improves)

## Sample 2: AI Function Calling - Thematic Blocks Schema

### Purpose

Defines structured output schema for AI-powered conversation segmentation. Enables the AI to analyze conversations and create thematic blocks with intelligent topic merging and multi-range support.

### Key Feature

**Smart Topic Merging**: AI identifies when the same topic appears multiple times in a conversation (e.g., "Vitamin D" discussed at messages 1-2, then again at 5-6) and creates a single block with multiple ranges instead of separate blocks.

### Code

    - Hierarchical topic organization (main_topic → subtopic)
    - Multi-range support for interrupted topics
    - Smart merging of related discussions

        }
    }
```

### Prompt Engineering Example

When calling the AI with this schema, we provide detailed instructions:

```python
analysis_prompt = f"""Analyze this conversation and segment it into thematic blocks.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Smart Topic Merging:**
   - If same topic appears multiple times (e.g., "Vitamin D" at msg 1-2, then 5-6), 
     create ONE block with MULTIPLE ranges
   - Example: {{"title": "Vitamin D", "ranges": [
       {{"start": "msg_01", "end": "msg_02"}}, 
       {{"start": "msg_05", "end": "msg_06"}}
     ]}}
   - Do NOT create separate blocks for the same topic!

2. **Message IDs:**
   - Each message has [msg_xxxxx] format
   - start MUST be User message
   - end MUST be Assistant message

3. **Subtopic Consistency:**
   - Use SAME subtopic name for same topic across conversation
   - Different aspects of same topic = ONE block with multiple ranges

Analyze the conversation now."""
```

### Why This Approach Works

**Traditional Approach (Fragmentation Problem):**
```
Conversation: Vitamin D → Weather → Vitamin D (continued)
Bad AI Output: 
  - Block 1: "Vitamin D Basics" (msg 1-2)
  - Block 2: "Weather" (msg 3-4)  
  - Block 3: "Vitamin D Dosage" (msg 5-6)
→ Result: 3 blocks, user loses connection between Vitamin D discussions
```

**Genesis Approach (Smart Merging):**
```
Same Conversation
Good AI Output:
  - Block 1: "Vitamin D Discussion" with 2 ranges (msg 1-2, msg 5-6)
  - Block 2: "Weather" (msg 3-4)
→ Result: 2 blocks, Vitamin D discussions logically connected
```

### Design Patterns Demonstrated

**1. Comprehensive Error Handling:**
- User authentication (via `get_current_user` dependency)
- Permission validation (block belongs to user)
- Data integrity checks (ranges exist, boundaries found)
- Graceful failure with meaningful error messages

**2. Multi-Range Logic:**
- Handles blocks with 1+ ranges seamlessly
- Uses first range as branch point (semantic start)
- Uses last range for metadata (total span)
- Calculates total messages across gaps

**3. Auto-Generation:**
- Branch name auto-generated from topic hierarchy if not provided
- Follows convention: `"main_topic: subtopic"` (e.g., "coding: JWT Setup")

**4. Rich Response:**
- Not just session ID, but full context about what was branched
- Ranges count shows multi-range awareness
- Message range shows semantic span

## Sample 4: Integration Test - User Isolation (Security)

### Purpose

Validates that users cannot access or modify each other's data. This is a critical security requirement for multi-user systems.

### Key Features

- **Defense in Depth:** Each layer (sessions, messages, blocks, inventory) independently validates user ownership
- **Attack Vector Coverage:** Tests both read access (session hijacking) and write access (unauthorized deletion)
- **Regression Prevention:** Explicit tests ensure developers cannot accidentally remove user_id filters

### Code

```python
"""
Integration test for user isolation in session management.

This test validates that User B cannot access or delete User A's sessions.
Even though encryption provides data confidentiality, access control at the
database layer is critical for preventing unauthorized operations.
"""

import pytest
from genesis_tool.database.sessions import (
    create_session,
    session_exists,
    get_session_info,
    delete_session,
    get_session_tree
)
from genesis_tool.database.users import create_user


@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.security
def test_user_isolation_in_sessions(test_db):
    """Test that users cannot access or delete each other's sessions.
    
    CRITICAL: Layered Security (Defense in Depth)
    
    This test validates user isolation at the session management layer.
    Even though user isolation is tested in other modules, each layer
    must be independently secure to prevent:
    - Session hijacking (User B accessing User A's session)
    - Unauthorized deletion (User B deleting User A's session)
    
    Rationale for "duplication":
    - Different attack vectors require different tests
    - Regression prevention (developer could forget user_id filter)
    - Documentation as code (shows explicitly that functions MUST check user_id)
    """
    # Create two users
    user_a_id, user_a_service = create_user("user_a", "password_a")
    user_b_id, user_b_service = create_user("user_b", "password_b")
    
    # User A creates session
    session_a = create_session(user_id=user_a_id, branch_name="A's session")
    
    # Verify User A can access their session
    assert session_exists(session_a, user_a_id)
    assert get_session_info(session_a, user_a_id) is not None
    
    # Verify User B CANNOT access User A's session
    assert not session_exists(session_a, user_b_id)
    assert get_session_info(session_a, user_b_id) is None
    
    # Verify User B CANNOT delete User A's session
    result = delete_session(session_a, user_b_id)
    assert result is False
    
    # Verify User A's session still exists
    assert session_exists(session_a, user_a_id)
    
    # Verify User B's session tree is empty (doesn't see User A's sessions)
    tree_b = get_session_tree(user_b_id)
    assert len(tree_b) == 0
```

### Design Patterns Demonstrated

**1. Defense in Depth:**
- Each database function independently validates `user_id`
- No assumption that higher layers (API, auth) will catch all cases
- Multiple security layers prevent single point of failure

**2. Comprehensive Attack Coverage:**
- **Read Access:** `session_exists()`, `get_session_info()` return nothing for wrong user
- **Write Access:** `delete_session()` returns `False` for wrong user
- **List Access:** `get_session_tree()` shows only user's own sessions

**3. Explicit Security Testing:**
- Not just "it works", but "it fails securely"
- Tests the negative case (unauthorized access) as thoroughly as positive case
- Documents security requirements as executable code

**4. Multi-User Test Pattern:**
- Creates two independent users with separate credentials
- Verifies isolation in both directions (A→B and B→A)
- Tests both existence checks and data retrieval

## Sample 5: Unit Test - Encryption Roundtrip (Unicode)

### Purpose

Validates that encryption correctly handles real-world data including unicode characters (emoji, umlauts, CJK). This ensures UTF-8 encoding works correctly across the encryption/decryption cycle.

### Key Features

- **Unicode Support:** Tests emoji (🔐), CJK characters (世界), and European umlauts (Ü)
- **Roundtrip Integrity:** Verifies data survives encryption/decryption unchanged
- **Real-World Data:** Uses actual characters users would type, not just ASCII

### Code

```python
"""
Unit test for encryption service unicode handling.

Real-world user data contains unicode characters. This test ensures
the encryption service correctly handles UTF-8 encoding/decoding.
"""

import pytest
from genesis_tool.services.encryption_service import EncryptionService


@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.security
def test_encryption_unicode_characters(test_encryption_service):
    """Test encryption of unicode characters (emoji, umlauts, CJK).
    
    Real-world data contains unicode. This ensures UTF-8 encoding works correctly.
    
    Test Coverage:
    - Emoji (🔐): 4-byte UTF-8 sequences
    - CJK (世界): Multi-byte characters
    - Umlauts (Ü): Extended ASCII
    - Mixed content: ASCII + Unicode
    """
    plaintext = "Hello 世界! 🔐 Ümläüte Café"
    
    encrypted = test_encryption_service.encrypt(plaintext)
    decrypted = test_encryption_service.decrypt(encrypted)
    
    # Verify perfect roundtrip
    assert decrypted == plaintext
    
    # Verify specific unicode characters survived
    assert "世界" in decrypted  # CJK
    assert "🔐" in decrypted    # Emoji
    assert "Ü" in decrypted     # Umlaut
    
    # Verify it was actually encrypted (not plaintext)
    assert encrypted != plaintext
    assert encrypted.startswith("gAAAAA")  # Fernet token format
```

### Design Patterns Demonstrated

**1. Edge Case Testing:**
- Not just "happy path" ASCII data
- Tests real-world unicode that users actually type
- Covers multi-byte UTF-8 sequences (1-4 bytes)

**2. Comprehensive Assertions:**
- **Roundtrip Integrity:** `decrypted == plaintext`
- **Character Preservation:** Each unicode type explicitly verified
- **Actual Encryption:** Confirms data was transformed, not just passed through

**3. Security Property Verification:**
- Fernet token format check (`gAAAAA` prefix)
- Ensures encryption actually happened
- Documents expected ciphertext structure

**4. Fixture Usage:**
- `test_encryption_service` fixture provides consistent test setup
- Reduces boilerplate in tests
- Ensures proper cleanup after test

## Architecture Insights

### Zero-Access Encryption Flow

```
User Login (Password + User ID from JWT)
       ↓
Server: PBKDF2 (600k iterations) + User Salt (from DB)
       ↓
Encryption Key (32 bytes, base64) [derived server-side, exists only in RAM]
       ↓
Key embedded in new JWT (stateless session)
       ↓
Subsequent Requests: JWT → Extract Key → Fernet Encryption/Decryption
       ↓
Data at Rest (Encrypted in SQLite)
```

**Key Security Properties:**
- ✅ Keys never stored persistently (only in JWT for session duration)
- ✅ Key derivation happens server-side using password + salt
- ✅ Server cannot decrypt without user password (zero-access principle)
- ✅ Each user has unique salt (prevents rainbow tables)
- ✅ JWT contains derived key → stateless authentication (no server-side session storage)

### Multi-Provider AI Architecture

The backend abstracts AI provider differences behind a unified interface:

```python
# Simplified architecture (actual implementation in private repo)
class AIProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_message(self, context: str, user_input: str) -> str:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def supports_function_calling(self) -> bool:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def send_message_with_functions(self, context, user_input, functions) -> dict:
        pass

# Concrete implementations: GeminiProvider, ClaudeProvider, OpenAIProvider, OllamaProvider
```

This allows runtime model switching without code changes.
