## Executive Summary

Genesis-Tool is a **privacy-first AI conversation workbench** that addresses the context control problem: get precise control over AI context, instead of copy-pasting and manual history management, by leveraging **automated context extraction**, **AI-powered compression**, and **multi-source composition** – all with **zero-access encryption** and **self-hosting** capability.

---

## 📣 TL;DR

**Mission:** Empower users with privacy-first AI tools to create, refine, store and share knowledge in a safe environment.

**For Everyone:** Whether you're exploring personal interests, managing professional projects, or conducting research—Genesis-Tool adapts to your needs. From casual learners to legal professionals, from students to scientists.

**The Challenge:** Current AI tools force manual context management – hours wasted scrolling, copy-pasting, and merging context from multiple sessions. AI responses degrade over time (echo-chamber effect) as context becomes polluted with mixed topics.

**Genesis-Tool's Approach:** Automated context control through AI-powered extraction, compression, and multi-source composition. Think of it as "onboarding your AI" to your topics—so it understands YOUR context, YOUR terminology, YOUR needs. Stop playing Context Tetris. Get precise control over AI context with zero-access encryption and self-hosting.

The name "Genesis" reflects its purpose: **knowledge creation and synthesis**, not decision replacement.

**⚠️ Not Professional Advice:** This tool does not provide legal, medical, financial, or other professional advice. AI-generated content is for informational and organizational purposes only. The tool organizes and structures information—it does not provide professional judgment. Always consult qualified professionals (attorneys, physicians, financial advisors, therapists, etc.) for professional guidance. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for complete terms.

**Note on Independent Development:** Genesis-Tool was developed independently with a focus on privacy (zero-access encryption), self-hosting, and advanced knowledge management features including AI-powered topic extraction, multi-range blocks, and cross-session semantic search.

---

### The Problem

Current AI tools have three critical barriers preventing mainstream adoption:

1. **❌ Non-intuitive interfaces:** Linear chat doesn't match how humans think
2. **❌ No knowledge management:** Conversations are ephemeral and unstructured  
3. **❌ Privacy concerns:** User data often stored on third-party servers without encryption

**Result:** Despite their power, generative AI tools have not yet become a daily utility for the vast majority of people. The initial hype has given way to the challenge of practical, real-world integration.

### The Solution: 3-Layer Architecture

Genesis organizes AI interactions into **3 hierarchical layers** - each serving a distinct purpose in the knowledge workflow (see the [3-layer architecture diagram](#-what-is-genesis-tool) above):

**The 3 Layers:**

- **🏛️ Sanctuary:** Your persistent knowledge treasury (partially implemented)
- **🌟 Genesis Deck:** Where knowledge is CREATED through 3 modes:
  - **🔍 Research Mode:** Systematic fact gathering with source tracking (planned)
  - **🌟 Create Mode:** Exploratory thinking with branching and context control (implemented)
  - **🔄 Refine Mode:** Iterative refinement with multi-agent workflows (planned)
- **💬 Community Deck:** Global knowledge network for sharing and discovery (planned)

**Why this architecture?** Different thinking modes require different tools. Creating knowledge (Genesis Deck) needs different workflows than storing it (Sanctuary) or sharing it (Community).

## 🚀 Core Features and Technologies

### 1. Zero-Access Encryption
Your conversations are encrypted with YOUR password using industry-standard cryptography (PBKDF2 + Fernet).  
The architecture is designed to prevent server operator access to plaintext data.

**Key benefit:** Privacy-first architecture with client-side key derivation. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for security limitations and user responsibilities.

### 2. Automatic Branching ("Chat-Multiverse")
Edit any past message with `@edit <position> <text>` → Genesis automatically creates a parallel timeline.
Explore "what if" scenarios without losing the original conversation, or create new, focused branches that carry only the relevant context forward. This is powered by block-filtered branching, allowing you to distill a single topic from a complex discussion.

**Auto-Branching Triggers:**
- **On Edit (always):** `@edit 3 Tell me about dogs` → Creates branch "main-edit-msg3"
- **On Summary (optional, configurable):** `@sum` → Can create new branch or stay in same chat (user-configurable via `@settings`)
  - **With branching:** Choose context window (0 to N Q&A pairs) → Creates focused summary branch
  - **Without branching:** Summary added to current chat, all messages kept (non-destructive)

**Key benefit:** Fearless editing—history is always preserved, alternatives are always explorable.

### 3. Cross-Session Topic Search
Search: "JWT authentication" → Find ALL relevant message-pairs across months of conversations.  
Aggregate results into a new focused branch.

**Key benefit:** Your knowledge persists indefinitely with semantic connections across time.

### 4. Smart Summarization & Knowledge Integration
AI-generated summaries aren't just for compressing context; they are automatically saved as persistent items in your **Sanctuary** (persistent knowledge storage). Any summary can then be loaded as context into a completely different conversation, creating a continuous loop of knowledge refinement and reuse.

**Context Window Control:** When creating summary branches, choose how many Q&A pairs to keep (0 to N). This enables:
- **Focused summaries:** Keep only last 2 pairs for clean slate
- **Full context:** Keep all pairs for complete history
- **Hierarchical compression:** AI sees old summaries (iterative refinement)

**Transclusion Philosophy:** Summaries are not automatically copied to new branches. Instead, users manually load them via the Sanctuary (future UI: drag-drop "Context as Lego Blocks").

**Key benefit:** Transforms messy conversations into clean, reusable knowledge assets that compound in value over time.

### 5. Visual Knowledge Navigation
Conversations organized as semantic mindmaps (thematic blocks).  
See relationships, not just chronological lists.

**Key benefit:** A structured knowledge graph for precise navigation—no more endless scrolling.

### 6. Document Versioning
Full version history tracking for all documents with automatic versioning.  
Every change creates a new version while preserving the complete history.

**Key features:**
- **Automatic versioning:** Every document update creates a new version
- **Version history:** Access any previous version at any time
- **Non-destructive:** Original versions are never deleted
- **Rollback support:** Restore any previous version if needed

**Key benefit:** Never lose work, track changes over time, experiment fearlessly.

### 7. User-Friendly Configuration
Unified `@settings` menu for all configuration:
- **AI Model & Privacy:** Choose between cloud providers (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT) or local AI (e.g., Ollama) in one menu
- **Summary Behavior:** Configure whether summaries create new branches or stay in same chat
- **Advanced Settings:** Customize prompts, tags, and topics for your workflow

**Note:** Provider names (Gemini, Claude, GPT, Ollama) are mentioned for technical reference only and do not constitute endorsement, comparison, or affiliation. All trademarks remain the property of their respective owners. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for trademark information.

**Key benefit:** Simple, intuitive configuration without technical complexity—privacy and automation settings in one place.
