# Collaborative Workspaces

## Overview

Multi-user canvas for team collaboration with shared Sanctuary and real-time synchronization.

## The Vision

Transform Genesis-Tool from a personal knowledge workstation into a collaborative team platform while maintaining zero-access encryption and user sovereignty.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-User Canvas
- **Shared workspace** for team projects
- **Real-time collaboration** on multi-agent workflows
- **Role-based access control** (Owner, Editor, Viewer)
- **Activity feed** showing team member actions

### 2. Shared Sanctuary
- **Team knowledge base** with shared summaries and blocks
- **Permission system** (public, team-only, private)
- **Version control** for collaborative editing
- **Conflict resolution** for simultaneous edits

### 3. Real-Time Synchronization
- **Live updates** when team members add/edit content
- **Presence indicators** showing who's online
- **Cursor tracking** in shared documents
- **Comment system** for async collaboration

### 4. Privacy & Security
- **End-to-end encryption** for team workspaces
- **Shared encryption keys** (team-specific)
- **Audit log** for compliance
- **Data sovereignty** (self-hosted option)

## Use Cases

### 1. Research Teams
**Scenario:** Academic research group working on a paper

**Workflow:**
- Shared Research Deck for literature collection
- Shared Knowledge Deck for findings
- Collaborative Refine Mode for paper refinement
- Real-time comments and feedback

### 2. Legal Teams
**Scenario:** Legal professionals organizing case materials collaboratively

**Note:** This example demonstrates collaborative case organization.

**Workflow:**
- Shared case information in Knowledge Deck
- Parallel document drafting in Refine Mode
- Information verification by team members
- Senior review and professional approval

### 3. Development Teams
**Scenario:** Technical documentation for large codebase

**Workflow:**
- Shared technical knowledge base
- Multiple writers working on different sections
- Technical reviewers providing feedback
- Version control for documentation

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Encryption with Collaboration
**Challenge:** How to maintain zero-access encryption with shared workspaces?

**Solution:**
- **Team encryption keys** derived from team password
- **Key sharing protocol** for new members (asymmetric cryptography)
- **Revocation mechanism** when members leave (key rotation)
- **Hybrid approach:** Personal + Team workspaces

**Advanced Architecture:** See [zero-access-collaboration.md](zero-access-collaboration.md) for Git-like object storage, AI-powered merging, and cryptographic details.

### 2. Conflict Resolution
**Challenge:** What happens when two users edit the same item simultaneously?

**Solution:**
- **Git-like object storage** (each edit = encrypted commit)
- **Client-side conflict detection** (server never sees content)
- **AI-powered semantic merging** (understands meaning, not just text)
- **Signed merge commits** (cryptographic proof of authorship)
- **Manual fallback** (user resolves complex conflicts)

**Note:** Traditional approaches (Operational Transformation, Last-Write-Wins) require server access to content, which breaks zero-access encryption. See [zero-access-collaboration.md](zero-access-collaboration.md) for technical details.

### 3. Performance at Scale
**Challenge:** Real-time sync with 10+ team members?

**Solution:**
- **WebSocket connections** for live updates
- **Differential sync** (only send changes)
- **Caching layer** for frequently accessed items
- **Load balancing** for large teams
