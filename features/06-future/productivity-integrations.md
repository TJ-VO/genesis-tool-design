## Calendar Integration

### Import & Sync

- **One-Time Import:** Load your calendar once for AI context
- **Live Sync (Optional):** Keep calendar synchronized (user must explicitly enable)
- **Privacy First:** Calendar data encrypted locally, never sent to external servers
- **Selective Sharing:** Choose which calendars to share with AI (work, personal, family)

**Use Cases:**
```
User: "When should I schedule the dentist appointment?"
AI: "You have a free slot on October 15 at 3 PM. Shall I add it to your calendar?"

User: "Remind me to prepare for the meeting with Dr. Müller"
AI: "Meeting is tomorrow at 10 AM. I'll remind you 2 hours before."
```

### Smart Scheduling

**AI-Assisted Scheduling:**
- **Context-Aware Suggestions:** AI considers your existing appointments, preferences, and deadlines
- **Buffer Time:** Automatically suggests breaks between meetings
- **Travel Time:** Accounts for commute or travel between locations
- **Priority-Based:** Urgent tasks get prime time slots

**Example:**
```
User: "I need to file the legal brief by October 11"
    ↓
AI analyzes calendar:
- October 9: Client meeting (3 hours)
- October 10: Free afternoon
- October 11: Deadline
    ↓
AI: "I recommend scheduling 4 hours on October 10 at 2 PM for the brief.
     That's your last free window before the deadline. Shall I block it?"
    ↓
User: "Yes, and add a reminder"
    ↓
AI: "Done. Reminder set for October 10 at 1:45 PM."
```

---

### Deadline Reminders

**Never Miss a Deadline:**
- **Configurable Alerts:** Choose when to be reminded (2 hours, 1 day, 1 week before)
- **Smart Notifications:** AI suggests preparation time based on task complexity
- **Cross-Device Sync:** Notifications on desktop, mobile, and web

**Privacy Note:** All reminders are processed locally. No data leaves your device unless you explicitly enable cloud sync.

## Email Assistant

### Template-Based Email Generation

**AI-Powered Email Drafting:**
- **Legal Templates:** Formal letters, contract terminations, legal notices
- **Business Templates:** Meeting requests, project updates, status reports
- **Personal Templates:** Cancellations, complaints, inquiries

**Example: Product Return Letter**
```
User: "I need to return a product that wasn't delivered on time"
    ↓
AI: "I'll draft a formal cancellation letter. What's the product and order number?"
    ↓
User provides details
    ↓
AI generates:
---
Subject: Cancellation of Order #12345 - Late Delivery

Dear [Company],

## Session Timer & Health Features

### Work-Life Balance Monitoring

**AI as Your Health Assistant:**

- **Break Suggestions:** Recommends breaks based on research (Pomodoro, 52/17 method)
- **Configurable:** User sets preferences (e.g., "Remind me every 90 minutes")
- **Non-Intrusive:** Gentle notifications, never forced interruptions

**Example:**
```
User working for 2 hours straight
    ↓
AI: "You've been working for 2 hours. Research shows a 15-minute break
     improves focus and productivity. Take a walk? ☕"
    ↓
User: "Remind me in 30 minutes"
    ↓
AI: "Got it. I'll check back at 3:30 PM."
```

---

### Privacy-First Design

**All Health Data Stays Local:**
- No cloud sync (unless user explicitly enables)
- No analytics sent to external servers
- User can delete all tracking data anytime
- Fully transparent: User sees exactly what's tracked

## Task Management Integration

### Smart To-Do Lists

**AI-Enhanced Task Management:**
- **Priority Suggestions:** AI recommends task order based on deadlines and dependencies
- **Time Estimates:** AI suggests how long each task will take
- **Calendar Integration:** Tasks automatically scheduled in free slots
- **Dependency Tracking:** "Task B can't start until Task A is done"

**Example:**
```
User: "I need to prepare the research proposal, analyze data, and meet with supervisor"
    ↓
AI analyzes:
- Research proposal requires data analysis (dependency)
- Supervisor meeting is Friday (deadline)
- Analysis and proposal writing are time-intensive tasks
    ↓
AI suggests:
1. Analyze data (Tuesday, 2-5 PM)
2. Draft research proposal (Wednesday, 9 AM - 1 PM)
3. Supervisor meeting (Friday, 10 AM)
    ↓
User: "Looks good, schedule it"
```

## Cross-Deck Integration

### How Productivity Features Work with Memory Decks

**Calendar + Research Deck:**
```
User: "I have a meeting about climate policy tomorrow"
    ↓
AI: "Would you like me to prepare a research dossier on urban adaptation strategies?"
    ↓
User: "Yes"
    ↓
Research Deck opens, AI gathers relevant studies
    ↓
Summary saved to Knowledge Deck for meeting
```

**Email + Refine Mode:**
```
User: "Draft a formal response to this email"
    ↓
Refine Mode opens with email context loaded
    ↓
AI generates draft, Content AI reviews, Form AI polishes
    ↓
Final email ready to send
```

**Calendar + Knowledge Deck:**
```
User: "What do I need to know for the meeting at 3 PM?"
    ↓
AI searches Knowledge Deck for relevant items
    ↓
AI: "Here are 3 summaries related to the meeting topic. Load them?"
```
